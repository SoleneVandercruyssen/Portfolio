    <h1>Hi again !</h1>
    <p>So my name is Sol√®ne Vandercruyssen i'm currently learning how to code and create website.
        This is a new passion for me and i'm really excited to learn more about it.
        Before i was interested in painting, drawing and i'm still interested in it but i wanted to learn something new.
        I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm also learning how to use Git and GitHub.
